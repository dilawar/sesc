This is a clone of http://sesc.sourceforge.net/

This is a slightly different version of this application. It compiles on modern
linux distribution. If you are having

   g2c.h file is not found 

Then this is the version for you.

Check out a MyApplication folder for a very small Makefile project which does
almost nothing.

This repo was set-up to answer this question on our tech-group.
