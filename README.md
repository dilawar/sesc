sesc
====

This is a clone of http://sesc.sourceforge.net 

This codebase has been modified. It compiles with latest gcc. If you are having

   g2c.h file is not found 

issues. Then this is the version for you.

Also check out `MyApplication` folder for a very small Makefile project which does
almost nothing.

This repo was set-up to answer this question on our tech-group.
