sesc
====

This is a clone of http://sesc.sourceforge.net 

This codebase has been modified to compile with latest gcc. If you are having
`g2c.h file is not found` issue. Then this is the version for you.

Also check out `MyApplication` folder for a very small Makefile project which
does almost nothing.

This repo was set-up to answer this question on our tech-group.
