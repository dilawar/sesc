This directory is a copy of libsmp (thanks to the contributors of libsmp) with significant modifictations to implement 
thread-level speculation backend. This copy has been primarily made to prevent interference with standard SMP 
operation.

To compile these files please enable 'TLS=1' flag.(Additionally, DO NOT  enable SMP=1)
Use config file 'cmptls.conf' for the simulation with necessary parameter modifications.
