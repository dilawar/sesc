 When a project is created and it works fine, I strongly recommend
 to create a tag. Typical examples are when the paper submission is
 done. In that case you would like to tag all the files with the
 conference number, year, and some extra id. For example:

 $cvs tag micro-02-cherry-submission

 To see all the available tags use the status command.

 $cvs status
