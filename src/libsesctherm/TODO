  UpperCase classes

  spacing/tabulation

---------------------------
sink and spreader use a unified configuration

 Instead of using layer4 & layer5. They could
use a single layer on the description. After
all sink & spreader are required to be continuous.

 Move the sink/spread parameters to the same block.

---------------------------
Do not hardwire layers, let the configuration
choose. Then, it would be easy to check different
layer configurations without recompiling.

 The layer governing equations should be placed
in diffirent methods. Adding a new model (like
water cooling) should require only to add a new
method.

---------------------------
No need to ask for timeInterval. The time delta
can be approximated by the minimum area analized
and the alpha (specific_heat, density parameter).

 TimeInterval < 0.5 * (width*height)/alpha

 This has the advantage that the timeInterval
gets automatically adjusted based on the granularity.
If the TimeInterval is less than the sampling interval
(the E generated by SESC), I am not sure what interval
is the best to use.
