This directory implements the memory backend of an SMP
system. This implementation allows two modes of operation:

A) Write-through L1 cache (Cache.cpp) and private inclusive coherent
L2 cache (SMPCache.cpp). This is called SMP mode. In this mode:

1) SMPCache should be used as a private inclusive L2 cache, which is
the point of coherence.

2) Cache has to be used as a write-through private L1 cache.

B) Write-back coherent L1 cache (SMPCache.cpp) and shared
non-inclusive L2 cache (Cache.cpp). This is called CMP mode. In this
mode:

1) SMPCache should be used as a private L1 cache, which is the point
of coherence. Write-back is the only option.

2) Any caches below the L1 level (i.e., closer to memory) should be
non-inclusive (please notice that this is different from exclusive)
and shared among all the L1 caches. Only one level has been tested
(L2). To obtain a non-inclusive cache, add "inclusive = false" to the
section representing the L2 cache. Don't forget to set the lowerLevel
parameter of the L1 cache level as "shared".

For both configurations:

- The MSHR has to be non-aliasing, guaranteed (this means you shouldn't
use the full mshr, which allows aliasing; single mshr is recommended).

- Data movement is not modeled (only control messages), although it
is not too complicated to add the data messages (any candidates?).
